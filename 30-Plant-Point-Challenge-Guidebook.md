# THE 30-PLANT-POINT CHALLENGE

### A Complete Guidebook

*Based on the principles of Dr. Will Bulsiewicz*

*Feed Your Gut. Diversify Your Plate. Transform Your Health.*

---

## Chapter 1: What Is the 30-Plant-Point Challenge?

The 30-Plant-Point Challenge is a simple, science-backed dietary framework popularized by Dr. Will Bulsiewicz ("Dr. B"), a board-certified gastroenterologist and author of *Fiber Fueled* and *The Fiber Fueled Cookbook*. The premise is elegant: eat 30 or more different plant species every week to maximize the diversity of your gut microbiome.

The science behind the challenge comes from the landmark American Gut Project, the largest published study of the human microbiome. Researchers found that people who consumed 30 or more different plants per week had significantly more diverse gut bacteria than those who consumed 10 or fewer, regardless of whether they identified as vegan, vegetarian, or omnivore. Gut microbial diversity is consistently linked to stronger immune function, improved mental health, better metabolic outcomes, and reduced inflammation.

This is not a restrictive diet. You do not eliminate any food group. You simply add variety. Meat-eaters, vegetarians, and vegans can all play. The goal is accumulating 30 unique plant points across a full seven-day window.

> 🌱 **The Core Principle:** Every distinct plant species you eat in a week earns you points. Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds each earn 1 full point. Herbs and spices earn ¼ point each (because you consume them in smaller quantities). The weekly target is 30 points.

## Chapter 2: The Scoring System

Understanding how points are awarded is critical to playing the challenge correctly. Here is the official breakdown:

| Plant Category | Points Per Unique Item | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Fruits | 1 point each | Each distinct species counts |
| Vegetables | 1 point each | Each distinct species counts |
| Whole Grains | 1 point each | Must be whole, not refined |
| Legumes | 1 point each | Beans, lentils, chickpeas, etc. |
| Nuts | 1 point each | Each type is a separate point |
| Seeds | 1 point each | Chia, flax, hemp, sesame, etc. |
| Herbs (fresh/dried) | ¼ point each | 4 herbs = 1 full point |
| Spices | ¼ point each | 4 spices = 1 full point |

### Key Scoring Rules

**Rule 1 — Uniqueness Resets Weekly:** Your count resets to zero every Monday (or whichever day you designate as your start day). Eating an apple on Monday and an apple on Thursday still counts as only 1 point for that week.

**Rule 2 — Species, Not Preparations:** A roasted carrot and a raw carrot are the same carrot. You don't earn extra points for cooking the same plant a different way. The point is tied to the plant species, not the dish.

**Rule 3 — Herbs and Spices Stack:** Because you consume herbs and spices in small quantities, each one earns ¼ point. This means 4 unique herbs/spices = 1 full point. A well-spiced curry can easily contribute 1–2 full points from seasonings alone.

**Rule 4 — Variety Within Varieties Counts (Sometimes):** Different lentil types (red, green, brown) count separately because they have distinct nutritional profiles. But different colors of bell pepper do not, because they are the same species at different ripeness stages. See the edge cases chapter for the full breakdown.

**Rule 5 — Whole Foods Rule:** The plant must be consumed in a relatively whole or minimally processed form. White flour, refined sugar, and extracted oils do not count. Whole wheat flour, dried fruit with no added sugar, and frozen vegetables do count.

## Chapter 3: Plant Categories Deep Dive

Below is a comprehensive reference of what counts in each category, with examples to make tracking effortless:

| Category | Examples That Each Count as 1 Point |
|---|---|
| **Fruits** | Apple, banana, blueberry, strawberry, mango, kiwi, orange, grapefruit, pear, pomegranate, fig, date, watermelon, pineapple, cherry, plum, peach, raspberry, blackberry, avocado, tomato, lemon |
| **Vegetables** | Broccoli, spinach, kale, carrot, sweet potato, bell pepper, onion, garlic, cauliflower, zucchini, asparagus, beet, artichoke, Brussels sprouts, celery, cucumber, eggplant, leek, radish, turnip, mushroom* |
| **Whole Grains** | Oats, brown rice, quinoa, barley, farro, buckwheat, millet, amaranth, sorghum, teff, rye, spelt, freekeh, wild rice, whole wheat, corn/maize |
| **Legumes** | Black beans, chickpeas, lentils (red, green, brown each count separately), kidney beans, navy beans, pinto beans, edamame/soybeans, split peas, fava beans, black-eyed peas, mung beans, adzuki beans, lima beans, peanuts |
| **Nuts** | Almonds, walnuts, cashews, pecans, pistachios, hazelnuts, macadamia, Brazil nuts, pine nuts, chestnuts |
| **Seeds** | Chia seeds, flaxseeds, hemp seeds, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds (pepitas), sesame seeds, poppy seeds |
| **Herbs** | Basil, cilantro, parsley, mint, rosemary, thyme, dill, oregano, chives, sage, tarragon (¼ pt each) |
| **Spices** | Turmeric, cumin, cinnamon, ginger, black pepper, paprika, coriander, cardamom, nutmeg, cloves, cayenne, fennel seed, mustard seed, star anise, sumac, za'atar blend (¼ pt each) |

*\*Mushrooms and seaweed are not technically plants (they are fungi and algae, respectively), but Dr. Bulsiewicz includes them in the challenge because they feed beneficial gut bacteria in ways comparable to plant fiber.*

## Chapter 4: The Complete Edge Cases Guide

This is the section most people need. Real-world eating creates endless gray areas. Here is a definitive ruling on every common question, with the reasoning explained:

| Scenario | Ruling | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Red, green, brown lentils | 1 point EACH | Different varieties = different fiber profiles & nutrients |
| Red, green, yellow bell pepper | 1 point TOTAL | Same species (Capsicum annuum), just different ripeness |
| Kale vs. collard greens | 1 point EACH | Different cultivars with meaningfully different nutrients |
| Baby spinach vs. mature spinach | 1 point TOTAL | Same plant at different growth stages |
| Tofu, tempeh, edamame | 1 point TOTAL (soy) | All derived from soybeans — same source plant |
| White rice | 0 points | Refined grain, not whole — switch to brown rice |
| White potato vs. sweet potato | 1 point EACH | Different species entirely (Solanum vs. Ipomoea) |
| Peanuts | 1 point (legume) | Botanically a legume, not a nut — counts under legumes |
| Coconut | 1 point (fruit) | Technically a drupe/fruit — counts as 1 plant point |
| Coffee & tea | 1 point EACH | Derived from distinct plants; counts if consumed |
| Dark chocolate (>70%) | 1 point (cacao) | Minimally processed cacao bean counts |
| Wine / beer | 0 points | Alcohol processing negates microbiome benefit |
| Olive oil | 0 points | Extracted oil; eat whole olives for the point |
| Dried fruit (no added sugar) | 1 point each type | Same plant, concentrated — still counts |
| Frozen vegetables | 1 point each type | Flash-frozen retains nutrients; fully valid |
| Canned beans (no additives) | 1 point each type | Rinse to reduce sodium; still counts |
| Fermented plants (kimchi, sauerkraut) | 1 point + bonus | Counts for the base plant AND adds probiotics |
| Juice (100% fruit/veg) | 1 point per plant | Counts, but whole form preferred for fiber |
| Smoothie ingredients | 1 point per plant | Each distinct plant ingredient counts separately |
| Mushrooms | 1 point* | *Fungi, not plants — but Dr. B includes them |
| Seaweed / kelp / nori | 1 point each type | Algae, not plants — but included in spirit of the challenge |
| Nutritional yeast | 0 points | It's a fungus and too processed to count as a plant point |
| Maple syrup / honey | 0 points | Highly processed sugars, even if plant/nature-derived |
| Sprouts (broccoli, alfalfa) | 1 point each type | Different micronutrient profile than mature plant; counts |
| Microgreens | 1 point per species | Count by the species of the microgreen |

### Additional Edge Case Rulings

**Mixed spice blends (curry powder, garam masala, Italian seasoning):** Count each identifiable component spice as ¼ point. A standard curry powder contains turmeric, cumin, coriander, fenugreek, and chili — that's 5 × ¼ = 1.25 points. However, if you cannot identify the individual spices, count the blend as ½ point total.

**Nut butters and seed butters (peanut butter, tahini, almond butter):** Yes, they count. The nut or seed is ground but not chemically processed. Peanut butter = 1 point for peanuts (under legumes). Tahini = 1 point for sesame seeds.

**Plant-based milks (oat milk, almond milk, soy milk):** Count with a caveat. They are heavily diluted and processed, but the base plant still counts as 1 point. Do not double-count: if you eat whole almonds AND drink almond milk, that is still only 1 almond point.

**Popcorn:** Yes! Popcorn is a whole grain (corn/maize) and counts as 1 point. Must be air-popped or lightly prepared — movie theater popcorn drenched in artificial butter still technically counts for the corn, but the point of the challenge is nourishment.

**Pickled vegetables (pickles, pickled onions, kimchi):** The base vegetable counts. Fermented versions (like true kimchi or naturally fermented pickles) get a bonus nod because fermentation adds probiotic benefits, though no extra point.

**Seitan:** 0 points. It is vital wheat gluten — a refined, isolated protein, not a whole plant.

**Cocoa powder (unsweetened):** 1 point. Minimally processed from cacao beans. Hot cocoa made with cocoa powder counts.

**Vanilla extract:** ¼ point (treat as a spice). Whole vanilla bean = ¼ point as well.

**Same plant, different parts (beet root vs. beet greens):** 1 point TOTAL. Same plant, even though you're eating different parts. The exception: if the parts are sold and consumed as distinctly different products with different nutrient profiles (e.g., coconut flesh vs. coconut water is still 1 point for coconut).

## Chapter 5: Strategies for Hitting 30 Every Week

Reaching 30 points may feel daunting at first, but experienced players routinely hit 40–50+ with these strategies:

### Strategy 1: The Power Breakfast

Front-load your day. A single well-designed breakfast can deliver 5–8 plant points. Overnight oats with oats (1), chia seeds (1), walnuts (1), blueberries (1), banana (1), and cinnamon (¼) = 5.25 points before you leave the house.

### Strategy 2: The Spice Rack Hack

Most people underutilize their spice rack. Deliberately using 4–8 different spices across your meals each day adds 1–2 full points daily. Over a week, herbs and spices alone can contribute 7–10+ points. Keep a diverse spice collection and rotate through it.

### Strategy 3: The Mixed Bag Approach

Buy pre-mixed bags: mixed salad greens (3–5 species), trail mix (multiple nuts and seeds), frozen stir-fry vegetable blends (4–6 vegetables), and mixed bean soups. Each component in the mix counts individually.

### Strategy 4: The Grain Rotation

Instead of defaulting to rice every day, rotate through oats, quinoa, barley, farro, buckwheat, millet, and brown rice across the week. That is 7 points from grains alone with zero extra effort — just variety.

### Strategy 5: Smoothie Stacking

A single smoothie can contain 6–10 plants: spinach, banana, mango, hemp seeds, flaxseed, ginger (¼), turmeric (¼), oats, and almond butter. This is one of the most efficient delivery mechanisms for plant diversity.

### Strategy 6: The Topping Tax

Add a handful of seeds, a sprinkle of nuts, or fresh herbs to every single meal. This "topping tax" adds 2–4 incremental points per day without changing your meal plan. Pumpkin seeds on your soup, sesame seeds on your stir-fry, fresh cilantro on your tacos.

## Chapter 6: Sample Week Meal Plan

Here is a complete seven-day plan that hits 35+ unique plant points. This plan works for omnivores — you can add animal protein to any meal without affecting your plant score:

| Day | Breakfast | Lunch | Dinner / Snacks |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Mon** | Oatmeal + blueberries + walnuts + chia seeds + cinnamon (¼) | Quinoa bowl: chickpeas, spinach, red onion, avocado, lemon (¼) | Stir-fry: brown rice, broccoli, bell pepper, edamame, ginger (¼), garlic (¼) |
| **Tue** | Smoothie: banana, kale, hemp seeds, flaxseed, mango | Lentil soup: red lentils, carrot, celery, turmeric (¼), cumin (¼) | Sweet potato + black beans + corn + cilantro (¼) + paprika (¼) |
| **Wed** | Rye toast + almond butter + sliced pear + pumpkin seeds | Mediterranean: farro, cucumber, tomato, artichoke, fresh basil (¼) | Cauliflower curry: cauliflower, peas, cashews, coriander (¼), cardamom (¼) |
| **Thu** | Buckwheat pancakes + raspberries + pecans + nutmeg (¼) | Buddha bowl: millet, beet, radish, sunflower seeds, tahini (sesame) | Mushroom risotto (barley): leek, asparagus, thyme (¼), parsley (¼) |
| **Fri** | Overnight oats: oats, strawberry, pistachio, poppy seed, vanilla | Black-eyed pea salad: collards, cherry tomato, red pepper flake (¼) | Eggplant + zucchini bake: pine nuts, oregano (¼), rosemary (¼) |
| **Sat** | Acai bowl + coconut + fig + macadamia + mint (¼) | Wild rice + navy beans + Brussels sprouts + sage (¼), black pepper (¼) | Sorghum bowl: kidney beans, turnip, kale, dill (¼), cayenne (¼) |
| **Sun** | Teff porridge + date + Brazil nut + cinnamon (¼) + clove (¼) | Split pea soup: split peas, potato, carrot, chive (¼), tarragon (¼) | Celebration meal: amaranth, fava beans, fennel, pomegranate, star anise (¼) |

> 📊 **Weekly Tally from This Plan:** This sample week hits approximately 68 unique plants (including herbs/spices at ¼ point each): ~18 fruits, ~20 vegetables, ~10 whole grains, ~10 legumes, ~10 nuts/seeds, plus ~32 herbs and spices contributing ~8 full points. Total: approximately 36 full plant points.

## Chapter 7: Common Mistakes and Pitfalls

### Mistake 1: Counting Processed Foods

White bread, white pasta, fruit juice concentrate, refined sugar, and vegetable oils do not count. The rule of thumb: could you recognize the original plant? If a food has been stripped of its fiber and processed beyond recognition, it does not earn a point.

### Mistake 2: Double-Counting the Same Species

Eating chickpeas on Monday and hummus on Wednesday is still 1 chickpea point for the week. Similarly, having almond milk in your coffee and sliced almonds on your salad is 1 almond point. Track by species, not by dish.

### Mistake 3: Ignoring the Herb/Spice Quarter-Point Rule

Some players count each herb as a full point. This inflates scores and defeats the purpose. Herbs and spices are ¼ point because you eat them in trace amounts. A pinch of cumin provides microbial benefit, but not the same fiber load as a cup of lentils.

### Mistake 4: Not Tracking at All

The challenge works because of awareness. If you do not write down what you eat, you will overestimate your variety and miss the behavioral nudge that drives better choices. Use the tracker at the end of this guide, a notes app, or a whiteboard on your fridge.

### Mistake 5: Going Too Hard Too Fast

If you currently eat 8–10 plant species per week, jumping to 30 overnight can cause bloating and gas as your gut bacteria adjust to the sudden increase in fiber diversity. Increase by 5 plants per week over a month to give your microbiome time to adapt.

---

## Chapter 8: Why It Works — The Science

Your gut contains approximately 38 trillion microbes representing thousands of species. Each species of bacteria has dietary preferences — specific fibers, polyphenols, and resistant starches that fuel its growth. When you eat only a narrow range of plants, you feed only a narrow range of bacteria. The rest starve, your microbial diversity drops, and your gut ecosystem becomes fragile.

Research from the American Gut Project (McDonald et al., 2018, published in *mSystems*) demonstrated that the number of unique plant types consumed per week was the single strongest predictor of gut microbial diversity — more predictive than whether someone was vegan, vegetarian, or omnivore. Participants eating 30+ plants per week showed:

- **Greater alpha diversity:** More species richness in their gut samples.
- **More short-chain fatty acid producers:** Bacteria that produce butyrate, propionate, and acetate — compounds that reduce inflammation, strengthen the gut barrier, and regulate immune function.
- **Lower antibiotic resistance genes:** A diverse microbiome appears more resilient and less prone to harboring resistance genes.

Additional research supports that gut microbial diversity is associated with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, obesity, inflammatory bowel disease, depression, anxiety, and even certain cancers. The 30-plant challenge is a behavioral tool that translates this research into a simple, actionable weekly practice.

## Chapter 9: Special Situations and FAQs

### For People with IBS or Gut Sensitivities

Dr. Bulsiewicz specifically addresses this: the challenge is not about volume, it is about variety. You do not need to eat a full serving of 30 different plants. A single blueberry on your oatmeal counts. A teaspoon of chia seeds counts. People with IBS can still reach 30 points by using small amounts of many plants rather than large amounts of a few. Work with a dietitian if you have specific FODMAP triggers — the Low FODMAP diet and the 30-plant challenge are not mutually exclusive; you simply choose from the low-FODMAP plant list.

### For Families with Picky Eaters

The challenge can be gamified for kids: make a colorful wall chart, let children pick new plants at the grocery store, and blend hidden plants into smoothies or sauces. Even getting children from 5 weekly plants to 15 represents a meaningful improvement in gut health. The exact number 30 is a target for adults.

### For People on a Budget

Frozen vegetables, canned beans, dried lentils, oats, and bulk seeds are among the cheapest foods available and are all fully valid for the challenge. A bag of 15-bean soup mix costs a few dollars and contains — you guessed it — 15 different legume points.

### For Travelers

Pack small bags of mixed nuts, seeds, and dried fruit. Order salads with diverse ingredients at restaurants. Ask for extra vegetable toppings. Airport smoothie bars can be surprisingly effective. Lower your target to 20 during travel weeks and don't stress about it.

### For Athletes and High-Protein Diets

The challenge does not limit protein intake. Add your chicken breast, steak, fish, or protein shake as normal — then build the plant variety around it. Legumes (lentils, chickpeas, edamame) are high-protein plants that do double duty.
